# PyTorch-Deep-Learning-Tutorial
A PyTorch tutorial that goes from 0 to CNNs.
Pytorch is a different kind of deep learning library (dynamic, rather than static), which has been adopted by many (if not most) of the researchers that
we most respect, and in a recent Kaggle competition was used by nearly all of the top 10 finishers.
This tutorial will give you a head start if you want to go deeper in Machine Learning, Data classification and Natural Language Processing.
